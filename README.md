## This is a python wrapper for c++ boost lib
syntax is in NetworkX style 

## Setup
No dependency installation needed as 
boost can be found by cmakelist directly.
(this is really nice because the lib is huge.)
**runs out of box yay!**


## How to use
Simply try any graph algorithm in the project root dir:
- add header ```import booty_boost``` 
- use NetworkX API
(for now we only implemented dfs)
